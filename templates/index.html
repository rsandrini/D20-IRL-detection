        <h1>Roll dice IRL - DaaS</h1>
        <p>
            In the grand quest for glory, <span class="highlight">rolling a digital dice might tick the box, but let's be
            honest—it won't fulfill your soul.</span> That moment when the fate of your epic journey hangs in the balance,
            and all you've got is a click instead of a clatter? Heartbreaking.
        </p>

            But fear not, fellow adventurers, for I have conjured a solution that merges the best of both worlds!
        </p>
        <p>
            Behold, the magical apparatus designed to auto-roll a d20 dice, capturing the very essence of your roll in a
            gif and an image, thanks to the watchful eye of a webcam. No more will you lament leaving your dice at home,
            nor will you settle for soulless digital imitations.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this wizardry, you get the thrill of the roll and the convenience of digital precision. Roll physically,
            celebrate digitally, and let your soul sing with the true spirit of the game. Let the dice fly and the numbers
            land where they may—your epic tales are just a roll away!
