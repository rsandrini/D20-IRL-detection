The training data will be uploaded to the repository. The training data is a custom dataset of dice images. The dataset is used to train the SSD-MobileNet model with the TensorFlow 2 Object Detection API. The trained model is then converted to TensorFlow Lite format for efficient deployment on edge devices. You can find the current model in the repository under the `tflite1/custom_model_lite` directory.
